      %p 
        you can assign multiple users to a single band profile. We know that being in a band is a multi-person task, and we've designed the
        site with that in mind. Feel free to add each band member as an individual user, designating them with the authority to modify the
        band account as desired. Do you have a manager or any other people that play an integral role in relation to your band? Feel free
        to add them, too!
