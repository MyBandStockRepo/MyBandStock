What's up gang!

I'm Colin Miller and I head up Artist Relations at Mybandstock - I will be your personal contact for whatever you guys need. Now that you are part of the Mybandstock family, the next step is to start thinking about your project - what your raising money for.

After you read this email, either get a hold of me at 810 923 3175 or colin@mybandstock.com so we can start a dialogue!

Fill out the information about your band. You then will be asked to apply for your first project.  This is a very important part of MyBandStock - this project represents the first fundraising opporunity your band will undertake on MyBandStock. This will be the test of our working relationship with each other and your commitment to your fans. Each project should be for recording music. Whether it be a EP or a full length, it is up to you to sell your dream... but I would be more than happy to brainstorm ideas and options.  Along with this objective you will need to associate a value, or a dollar amount that would be enough to complete your project.  Choose wisely and honestly. 

The project description box (when you get to that page) exists so that all your fans can see and understand why you are raising this money. We will do this together when I sit down with you all, so don't worry about filling out the info. In addition, think of some contribution levels (how much people give you) and a few perks (what they get for how much they give you).


You can now proceed to your band control panel (if you ever get lost, there is always a link in the upper right once you have logged in) and begin building your profile.  Once this is complete it is very important that you click the "Publish!" button located on the "Control Panel" tab so that your carefully crafted profile is now revealed to the world.

Your band mailbox is found on the "Mail" tab on the band control panel.

So, please follow this link to create your band and get started! (if it doesn't show up as a link you can copy and paste it into your web browser.
