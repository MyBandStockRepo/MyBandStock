	%p
		My Stock Enterprises, LLC (“MyBandStock” or “we”) operates
		MyBandStock.com. This Privacy Policy describes MyBandStock’s use and sharing of
		personally identifiable information (“PII”-- your full name, email address, mailing
		address, telephone number, or credit card number) that Members may voluntarily provide
		to MyBandStock when they register (also known as “Registration PII”). The Term
		“User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. The term “Artist” refers to a User that also
		provides artistic content to MyBandStock and may offer Users the opportunity to
		purchase “shares” as more fully described in the MyBandStock.com Fan Agreement,
		MyBandStock.com Basic Artist Agreement and/or MyBandStock.com Alpha Artist
		agreement, as applicable. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by
		MyBandStock, including any MyBandStock-branded URL (the “MyBandStock
		Website”), the MyBandStock instant messaging service, the MyBandStock application
		developer service and other features (for example, music and video embedded players),
		MyBandStock mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered
		from time to time by MyBandStock in connection with the MyBandStock Website
		(collectively, the “MyBandStock Services”). The MyBandStock Services are hosted in
		the United States.

	%p
		WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR PII WITHOUT YOUR EXPRESS
		PERMISSION. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT STORE CREDIT CARD
		INFORMATION AND WE DO NOT PLAN ON EVER STORING CREDIT CARD
		INFORMATION. MYBANDSTOCK ARTISTS AND USERS WILL BE
		ALLOWED TO CONTACT YOU THROUGH THE MYBANDSTOCK SERVICES
		(E.G., THROUGH PRIVATE MESSAGING). IN ADDITION, ARTISTS WILL
		BE ABLE TO SEARCH BY ZIP CODE USERS WHO BECOME FAN MEMBERS
		OF AND/OR “SHAREHOLDERS” IN A GIVEN ARTIST.
	%br	
	%p
		The MyBandStock Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly
		collect PII from children under 13 years of age.
	%br		
	%p
		From time to time MyBandStock may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect
		industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features
		of the MyBandStock Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective
		upon posting by MyBandStock on the MyBandStock Website. Your continued use of the
		MyBandStock Services after MyBandStock posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your
		acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this
		Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If MyBandStock
		materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will
		continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been
		provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.

	%h3 COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PII AND NON-PII ON MYBANDSTOCK
	%br	
	%p
		General. When MyBandStock collects PII from you it is because you are
		voluntarily submitting Registration PII to us in order to register as a Member of
		MyBandStock. MyBandStock may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate
		in MyBandStock Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you
		want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in
		connection with content or suggestions you submit to MyBandStock for review.
	%br	
	%p
		In addition, MyBandStock collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate
		user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the MyBandStock
		Services, track usage, and for security purposes.
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock Members may also choose to provide or store non-PII information
		in their profiles, including but not limited to date of birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle
		choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or
		pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively “Profile
		Information”). The Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her
		sole discretion.
	%br		
	%p
		MyBandStock Members can change their Registration PII and Profile Information
		at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members and MyBandStock
		communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit
		Profile” portion of their MyBandStock profile. Link to Privacy Settings.

	%p  
		Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that MyBandStock places on your
		computer. MyBandStock uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, store Users’
		preferences, and determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to
		access certain material on the MyBandStock Services. Data in cookies may be read to
		authenticate user sessions or provide services.
	%br		
	%p
		Third party advertisements displayed on MyBandStock Services may also contain
		cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (known as “third party
		cookies”). MyBandStock does not control these third party cookies and Users of the
		MyBandStock Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising
		company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section
		below for more information on customized advertising on MyBandStock. A pixel tag is a
		tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types of views for
		that page. MyBandStock may allow third party pixel tags to be present on MyBandStock
		Services for purposes of advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection.
	%br	
	%p
		You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent,
		block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may
		not have access to certain features on the MyBandStock Services.
	%br
	%br	
	%h3 NOTICE: MYBANDSTOCK WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES.
	%br	
	%p
		When you voluntarily provide PII to MyBandStock, we will make sure you are
		informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being
		collected and the types of uses MyBandStock will make of the information to the extent it
		is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy
		Policy.
	%br	
	%p
		At the time you provide your PII, MyBandStock will notify you of your options
		regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below). Except as described in this Privacy
		Policy, MyBandStock will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given
		MyBandStock permission to do so (See “Use” below).
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other
		companies. MyBandStock Services may also carry advertisements from other companies.
		MyBandStock is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services
		operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the MyBandStock Services
		or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave
		MyBandStock Services via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets)
		or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third
		party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII
		they collect from you.
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies
		affiliated with MyBandStock (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: “Affiliated
		Companies”). Although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News America corporate
		Privacy Principles, Users who visit those Affiliated Company sites should still refer to
		their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this
		Privacy Policy.
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and
		advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile
		Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice
		questions like “Marital Status,” “Education” and “Children”) (“Structured Profile
		Information”), information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay
		questions like “About Me,” “Interests” and “Movies”) (“Non-Structured Profile
		Information”) and other non-PII about you may also be used to customize the online ads
		you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests. For example, based on
		your music interests we might display an advertisement to make sure you are advised
		when your favorite band is coming to town. The information used for this feature does
		not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties. If you would like to
		disable advertising customization for Non-Structured Profile Information, please log in
		and click here.
	%br	
	%p
		Some of the advertisements that appear on MyBandStock Services may also be
		delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize
		certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect
		non-PII about your visit to or use of MyBandStock Services, including information about
		the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To
		opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the
		technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please click here.
	%br	
	%p
		Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party developers may
		also be available on the MyBandStock Services. Third party applications are small bits of
		software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into Members’ profiles or shared
		with other Users. However, MyBandStock does not control the third party developers,
		and cannot dictate their actions. When a Member engages with a third party application,
		that Member is interacting with the third party developer, not with MyBandStock.
		MyBandStock encourages Members not to provide PII to the third party’s application
		unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.
	%br
	%br	
	%h3 CHOICE: MYBANDSTOCK WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII.
	%br	
	%p
		Except as described in this Privacy Policy, MyBandStock will get your
		permission before we use the PII you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the
		purpose for which it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not
		affiliated with MyBandStock.
	%br
	%br	
	%h3
		USE: MYBANDSTOCK'S USE OF PII
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock will only use the PII you provide under this Privacy Policy in a
		manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If MyBandStock obtains PII from a
		third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this
		Privacy Policy.
	%br	
	%p
		In order to locate other MyBandStock Members that you may already know in the
		physical world, MyBandStock allows Users to search for Members using Registration PII
		(i.e., full name or email address). MyBandStock also allows Users to browse for certain
		Profile Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e., schools and/or
		companies where Users may have attended or worked). MyBandStock may also enable
		Members to publicly display some Registration PII as an element of their Profile
		Information if they choose to do so via a profile setting under “Edit Profile.” Search
		engines may index the portion of a Member’s profile (including the Profile Information it
		contains) that is publicly displayed.
	%br	
	%p
		If you have consented to receive promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or
		notifications from MyBandStock, MyBandStock may periodically use your email address
		to send you such materials related to the MyBandStock Services, as applicable. If you
		want to stop receiving such materials from MyBandStock, you can change your profile
		settings under “Account Settings,” or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of
		each email.
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock employees, agents and contractors must have a business reason to
		obtain access to your PII. MyBandStock may share your PII with those who help us
		manage or provide MyBandStock Services’ information activities (for example, message
		board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with
		outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and
		prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.
	%br	
	%p
		These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some
		information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide MyBandStock
		with a specific service and not for any other purpose. MyBandStock may also provide
		your PII to a third party (which could include Artists if you have purchased a product or
		service directly from an Artist) in those instances where you have chosen to receive
		certain information, services or products and have been notified that the fulfillment of
		such a request requires the sharing of your PII. MyBandStock also may share your PII
		with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so.
	%br	
	%p
		As described in “Notice” above, MyBandStock may customize the advertising
		and marketing messages you receive on the MyBandStock Website, or may work with
		outside companies to do so. Your non-PII and/or Profile Information may be shared with
		these companies so this customization can be accomplished. MyBandStock prohibits
		these companies from sharing your non-PII and/or Profile Information with any third
		party or from using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page
		views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also be
		shared with MyBandStock’s advertisers and business partners.
	%br	
	%p
		There may be instances when MyBandStock may access or disclose PII, Profile
		Information or non-PII without providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend
		the legal rights or property of MyBandStock, our Affiliated Companies or their
		employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect
		the safety and security of Users of the MyBandStock Services or members of the public
		including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk
		management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if
		MyBandStock sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a
		material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a
		material part of its business, MyBandStock may transfer your PII to the party or parties
		involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.
	%br	
	%p
		When a Member who is located in the European Union chooses to post Profile
		Information that will be publicly disclosed, that Member is responsible for ensuring that
		such information conforms to all local data protection laws. MyBandStock is not
		responsible under the EU local data protection laws for Member-posted information.

	%h3 SECURITY: MYBANDSTOCK PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII
	%br	
	%p
		MyBandStock uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel
		and physical measures to safeguard PII and credit card information in its possession
		against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition,
		MyBandStock uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and
		appropriately complete.

		CHANGE YOUR PREFERENCES REGARDING YOUR PII AND HOW TO
		CONTACT MYBANDSTOCK ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS
	%br	
	%p
		Whenever possible, MyBandStock Members may review the Registration PII we
		maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a
		Member informs us is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view and change your
		Registration PII, Member preferences and Profile Information by logging into your
		account and accessing features such as “Edit Profile” and “Account Settings.”

		request while retaining any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable
		federal, state or local law.
