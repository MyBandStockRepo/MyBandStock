 johnmichael.fischer:  Ok -- a 'primary' email address would keep things mostly straightforward -- but there is certainly a simplicity argument
so that will work for now
 me:  yeah for now we figure just use one, and then maybe have a secondary emal table that we can implement later
or re-work the entire email table later and have a primary field
\
and by re-work i mean build
 johnmichael.fischer:  right.  Any more issues with git?

 me:  only a few but its weird
like it keeps finding merge issues with images...
at least for jake, it doesnt happen for me
and jake also has issues with the interactive rebase, it keeps saying noop instead of listing all of his commits
 johnmichael.fischer:  hmm ok
I'll see what I can find on that
 me:  yeah you should talk to jake about it because he seems to have the issues

 johnmichael.fischer:  Ok, I just pushed some stuff, which really just got rid of the user_notifier class from alpha
since rails 3.0 uses a different mailer class
 Sent at 3:28 PM on Wednesday
 me:  okay thats probably why we couldnt send emails
 johnmichael.fischer:  yeah, let me prune my multiple emails stuff
and checkin just the mailer stuff
 Sent at 3:32 PM on Wednesday
 johnmichael.fischer:  ok
i just pushed some rudimentary mailer stuff
 me:  okay
 johnmichael.fischer:  see app/mailers
and see line 218 in the users controller
the app/model/UserNotifier.rb is still there for legacy purposes and u ca port over any of those actions you want to the new mailer file with the new style
otherwise im going to nuke that UserNotifier.rb file in my next commit
see this as well
